# Guess the Number

### General info

This is the first project I've made using JavaScript.
It's simple game where you must guess the number from 0 to 99.
If your guess is lower or higher than hidden number you will be informed about that.
You have 10 chances which are also points.
The less points lost the higher your highscore will be.

### Features

- Dashboard with points and highscore
